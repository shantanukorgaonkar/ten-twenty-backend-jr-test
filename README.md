## Steps to get the project up and running
Before you run the commands, you will need the .env file shared with you over mail. However you are free to set up your own postgres db keeping in mind the correct variable names.

1. Set up the db - `npm run setup-db`
2. To launch the server - `npm run serve`
3. To launch in dev mode - `npm run dev`
